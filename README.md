[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/barbieswimcrew/dynamic-form-bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/barbieswimcrew/dynamic-form-bundle)

## Usage as bundle in symfony projects
The whole bunch of files need to be placed into the folder `src/Barbieswimcrew/Bundle/DynamicFormBundle` 
After that register the bundle to your AppKernel by `new Barbieswimcrew\Bundle\DynamicFormBundle\DynamicFormBundle()`
